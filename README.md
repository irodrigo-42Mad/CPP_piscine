### Getting Started

These instructions will permits you download and compile a copy of this proyect on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy this proyect on a live system or network.

```
	git clone https://github.com/irodrigo-42Mad/CPP_piscine.git
```
or

```
	go to https://github.com/irodrigo-42Mad/CPP_piscine.git and in the "Code" button, you can select download zip option and uncompress in your local machine.
```

### Prerequisites

For the correct compilation and use of these functions we must have installed in the system the GNU GCC compiler as well as the make tool to be able to mount the library.

	$ sudo apt install gcc
	$ sudo apt install build-essential

	after this you can compile this program correctly.

```



## Run
Each of the statements has several exercises inside, organizing in a folder structure with the exercise name and inside each exercise number, to test each of the exercises and examples of this pool, we must do the following:

Enter the main folder and then go to the desired number using the system `CD` command for example:
```
$

```



Change directory with `CD` command and them select exercise into primary structure like next procedures:
